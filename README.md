# Abstraction

Abstraction is a concept or idea.It's provide primary information.It shows only important things.Abstraction is a concept that simplifies complex ideas by focusing on the essential aspects while hiding the internal details. This repository provides a brief overview of abstraction and its importance in understanding and working with various systems and concepts.

## Introduction

Abstraction is a fundamental concept in computer science, mathematics, and various other fields. It involves simplifying complex systems, objects, or processes to make them more understandable and manageable. This repository aims to explain the significance of abstraction and how it is applied in different contexts.

It's has two part:
- Depending on context, how many codes come from real life.
- How many are exposed to others.

## Why Abstraction Matters

Understanding abstraction is crucial in software development, engineering, and problem-solving in general. It allows us to work with complex systems by interacting with a simplified model, without needing to know all the intricate details. This promotes efficiency, modularity, and a clearer understanding of the underlying concepts.

## Examples of Abstraction

Abstraction is everywhere, from everyday life to complex computer systems. Here are a few examples:

- **Washing Machine**: When using a washing machine, you don't need to understand its internal workings. You only need to know how to load your clothes, set the cycle, and press the start button. This abstraction hides the machine's complex mechanisms.

- **Architectural Blueprint**: An architectural blueprint is an abstraction of a building. It provides a high-level view of the structure, its layout, and design. You don't need to know every detail to understand the building's form and function.

# Encapsulation
Encapsulation  refers to the concept of bundling data (attributes or properties) and the methods (functions or procedures) that operate on that data into a single unit known as a class. Additionally, encapsulation restricts direct access to some of an object's components and prevents the accidental modification of data. This is often achieved through access modifiers in most OOP languages like public, private, and protected.

 - Class: Encapsulation begins with defining a class, which acts as a blueprint for objects. The class encapsulates data and methods that define the behavior of the objects created from it.
 - Private Members: Encapsulation allows you to hide the internal details of an object by making data members (variables) private. This means that these attributes are not directly accessible from outside the class.
 - Public Interface: Encapsulation exposes a controlled, public interface for interacting with objects. This interface typically consists of methods that allow you to access or modify the private members indirectly.

# Abstraction vs Encapsulation

This table summarizes the key differences between Abstraction and Encapsulation, two fundamental concepts in software development.

| Aspect         | Abstraction                   | Encapsulation                  |
|----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Definition     | Simplifies complex systems by focusing on essential features while hiding intricate details. | Bundles data and methods into a single unit, restricting direct access to some components. |
| Focus          | What the object does (external behavior) | How the object does it (internal implementation) |
| Level of Detail| Provides a high-level view, hiding internal complexities | Controls access to the internal state and protects it |
| User Perspective| Interacts with the object without needing to understand internal workings | Uses controlled methods to interact with the object, keeping the internal state protected |
| Generalization | Often involves abstract classes or interfaces defining common attributes and methods | Provides data protection and information hiding |
| Example        | In a car abstraction, focus on attributes like speed, fuel level, and methods like accelerate and brake | In a bank account encapsulation, protect the account balance and provide methods like deposit and withdraw |
| Benefits       | Manages complexity, makes systems more understandable | Protects data, enhances security, and ensures consistent access |
| Relationship   | Works with Encapsulation to build modular and maintainable systems | Works in conjunction with Abstraction to provide controlled access |
